# NeuroSyncNet: Scientific Rationale

## Core Hypothesis
Early brain activity (0–300ms after cue) contains **subtle predictive signals** that correlate with eventual motor imagery. These can be decoded using attention mechanisms and causal transformers trained to forecast downstream neural activity.

## Research Foundation
- “Decoding the Pre-Movement EEG” – Studies show early planning signals emerge ~200ms post-cue.
- Causal transformers allow **non-leaky** time-restricted forecasting, respecting neural dynamics.
- Contrastive learning has shown promise in extracting rich neural representations from EEG.

## Innovation Summary
- **Forecasts** neural intention, rather than passively waiting.
- **Self-supervised EEG learning** of temporal embeddings.
- Focuses on **pre-conscious thought decoding**, expanding BMI capability.

## Evaluation Plan
- Compare accuracy between early (0–0.3s) vs. full-trial (0.5–2.5s) classifiers.
- Latent similarity between predicted and actual neural space.
- Visualization of attention over brain regions.
